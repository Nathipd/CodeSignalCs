// Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by 
// removing no more than one element from the array.

//Example

    //For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
    //solution(sequence) = false.

    //There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

//Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one 
//element is also considered to be strictly increasing.
